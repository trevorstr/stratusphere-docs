## What is Stratusphere?

Stratusphere™️ is a FinOps tool that helps Private Equity and large enterprise firms monitor their spend and security posture in the cloud.
Although cloud platforms have native tools to explore costs and security posture, this data is often not surfaced across an entire portfolio of companies.
That's the key value proposition of Stratusphere; we provide visibility across not just your organization, but all of your portfolio companies as well, in a single view.

## How do I get started with Stratusphere?

Onboarding to Stratusphere only takes a few minutes, with the help of the StratusGrid team.
Once you're logged into Stratusphere, you simply:

- Deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack into your AWS Organizations payer account
- Then, update the stack with your AWS Organizations root identifier
- Finally, you create a support ticket to backfill Cost and Usage Reporting (CUR) data into an S3 bucket
